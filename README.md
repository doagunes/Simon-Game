# Simon-Game

This game is a digital version of the classic "Simon Says" game. Here's how it works:

1. Setup:
  
     There are four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow.

2. Starting the Game:

     The game starts when any key on the keyboard is pressed.

3. Generating a Pattern:

    The game will display a sequence of colors by flashing the buttons.
   
    The sequence starts with one color and gets longer each round.
   
    For each round, a new random color is added to the sequence.
   
4. Player's Turn:

    After the game shows the sequence, the player needs to replicate the pattern by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
   
    Each button click plays a sound and briefly changes the button's appearance to indicate it has been pressed.
   
5. Checking the Player's Input:

    The game compares the player's input with the generated pattern.
   
    If the player's input matches the sequence so far, the game continues to the next round with an extended sequence.
   
    If the player completes the sequence correctly, the game waits a moment and then adds another color to the sequence.
   
6. Game Over:

    If the player makes a mistake, the game ends.
   
    A sound plays to indicate the error, and the screen briefly changes to indicate the game over.
   
    The game displays the player's score (the highest level they reached) and prompts them to press any key to restart.
   
7. Restarting the Game:

    When the player presses any key, the game resets all variables and starts a new game from the beginning.

The main objective of the game is to see how long the player can remember and replicate the increasingly long sequence of colors.
